The instructor has mentioned some mistakes will be ignored with this design but it should be avoid in any MVVM design.

1- Do never pass any UI element to the view model class. (it happened in "MainViewModel" Constructor)

2- Do never store any password in the RAM after dencrypt it, send it directly to the wanted server.
